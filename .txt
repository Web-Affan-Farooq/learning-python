# Try to add a duplicate number to the set. What happens?
# Answer : Set is a known datatype only contains unique numbers. 

# Use .remove() to delete a number from the set. What if the number doesnâ€™t exist?
# Answer : It raises a keyError

# Use .discard() to delete a number that is not in the set. What happens?
# Answer : Returns None

# Use .pop() on a set and print the result and the remaining set.
